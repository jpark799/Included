### About

![Included First Page](https://i.ibb.co/MDgmRzJ/Screen-Shot-2019-11-04-at-9-42-58-AM.png)

I made this project because Diversity & Inclusion are much more than just buzzwords and the data doesn't lie. For example, companies that were in the top quartile for gender diversity were 15% more likely to have financial returns that were above their national industry medians and companies that were in the top quartile for racial diversity were 35% more likely. Throughout the project, I present a number of different points regarding why Diversity & Inclusion are so important and at the very end of the project, you're given the opportunity to enter your own company's demographics to see how you measure against software engineers in the US as well as the entire US workforce as a whole (data provided by the US Bureau of Labor).

I would like to take a second to also address that there is much more to diversity and inclusion than just racial and gender diversity. The data provided by the US Bureau of Labor could also be much more inclusive(including mixed races, Native Americans, etc.) but I chose to go with this data set because it was credible and represented the US as a whole.

This project was created as my capstone project for Project Shift. Please check them out if you are interested in learning to code!
